This is a html with pre-defined sections simulating the landing page.
It's style works with scss, and all variables are declared at the
beggining of the scss file, so it's easy to manipulate.

It's functionality consists in fast checks of different palettes with visual help.

Of course, you can change the size of the elements, but it's not intended to determinate
the sizes, but the color styles.

Feel free to do what you like anyways! :D

!!ATENTION!!
You must install the "Sass/Less/Scss/Typescript/Javascript/Jade/Pug Compile Hero Pro"
extension and set it on in order to modify the css file from the scss one.


Open index html with Live server to see the page. The css file is stored in 'dist' folder.
